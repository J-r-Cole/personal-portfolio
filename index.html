        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hey, I am an amatuer programmer currently learning web development and full stack 
            engineering. This site demonstrates some of my work as well as linking to 
            previous projects that I have either finished or that are in progress. I am also 
            studying at university in Australia in a different discipline so this is a bit of 
            a hobby for me.
